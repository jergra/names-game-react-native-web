We are guessing names instead of words.

I have adjusted the mobile-app code from:
    
    https://github.com/jergra/names-game-react-native
    C:\dev\names-game-react-native
    
so that it now works as a website.

In retrospect, if the aim is to use react-native-web to have a website,
it would be simpler and better to build it from scratch, 
rather than adjust an already built mobile app.


start:
    npm start

deployed:
    
    https://names-game-react-native-web.vercel.app/
    
    the mobile-app version:
        Use the Expo Go app to read the QR code at:
        https://expo.dev/@jergra43/names-game-react-native

update:
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push
